# Tile-World-Builder
A project that I was assigned to do for my Web Development class where I use javaScript to solve a number of challenges. The final challenge is to create a mini-game where the user can build their own tile-based Hogwarts/World.

# Takeaways
I learned how to use arrays, objects, and loops in JavaScript to solve 4 challenges and create a final mini-project where a user can build their own world with tiles. I achieved this by using JavaScript's built-in DOM query functions, the parent-child relationships between DOM objects, and many for loops to go through every block, display them in the selection menu, and display them in the user's world at their desired spot.
